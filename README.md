# Recipe finder with API, React.js, Material UI

- Get a random recipe if you are not sure what to eat, or search for a specific recipe. Or search by categories.
  Categories like countries or ingredients.

- Used **React.js**, Axios as a data fetching library to perform HTTP request with it.
- **Material UI**, react-router-dom, react-share, pagination, useParams, useEffect, useState were utilized.
- When Fetch API still have not loaded the specific request, then a spinner.gif shows the process it is not yet finished. This is for   making the app more user-friendly.
